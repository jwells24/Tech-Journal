# Create a random symmetric key, titled smem, given the public key we have already created outside of the scenario



# Create an encrypted variant of this key, titled smem-enc



# Read through a list of files in a directory and encrypt them, rename the file extension, and delete them



# Delete smem, the original random symmetric key, and make sure to leave smem-enc



# Using smem, prompt the user for verification and then decrypt their files
